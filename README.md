# LanceBot
 An intelligent Discord.py bot with sophisticated, custom modules.  
 LanceBot was a custom bot project I made for my own servers and to fulfill a variety of purposes, from utility to fun.

# Disclaimer  
This bot will not run as-is because tokens and API keys have been redacted (obviously), and additionally, it has no documentation. It is intended for users to pick up modules they want and to put them in their own bots.  
However, any decent programmer should be able to fix these things.
